Description: Makes setting up a shared folder for virtual machines a bit easier
 A metapackage, that creates a folder /mnt/shared with chmod 777, adds a group
 "vboxsf", adds user "user" to group "vboxsf". Facilitates auto-mounting of
 shared folders.
 .
 Currently only helps using shared folders with VirtualBox a bit easier (as in
 requiring fewer manual steps from the user). Might in future make use of other
 virtual machine's shared folders easier.
